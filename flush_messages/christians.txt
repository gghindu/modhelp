# Flush Notice: You (:pig:) do not meet the server's IQ requirements  
**Unfortunately, you are about to be flushed down the toilet.** 

But before you go, here are some helpful tips:
> * Mary lied about her affair because of people like you 
> * God should not die from three nails
> * The world is much more than 6,000 years old
> * A "noble" God wouldn't repeatedly genocide humans 
> * A "noble" God wouldn't brag about how jealous and petty he is

I hope the little tidbit above can help you navigate the complex world of today. Your current feelings of `humiliation` are perfectly normal, and in most cases will subside after a few weeks. If you are experiencing `extremist or radical ideations`, please contact your local authorities for help.

Good luck, and good riddance!
