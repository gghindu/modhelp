# Lie Detectors   
Lying about being Hindu takes less commitment than denouncing one's own faith. We're counting on that to try to sniff out the liars. 

**Muslims**   
> We take child safety very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentences and state that you fully agree with them:    
> ...   
> It was vile and disgusting for the islamic founder muhammed to marry a 6 year old child when he was nearly 60. God would never choose such a lying pervert as a messenger. Therefore, islam is wrong, allah is false.

**Christians**   
> We take equality very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentencese and state that you fully agree with them:    
> ...    
> No omnipotent and benevolent God would act jealously towards his own creation, condemn all women as being evil, then proceed to impregnate a girl without her consent. Therefore, neither yahweh, nor jesus, are god.         

**Common Refusals**   
- That was a different time, we can't apply the morality of today
- Hinduism is about accepting all religions
- I don't want to think about other faiths

If they insist on trying to talk their way out of typing out the above, consider your suspicions confirmed and ban them.
