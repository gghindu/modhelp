# Hindu Server Staff Guide

**Overall Goal**   
The Hinduism Discord server is a place for Hindus, and those interested in Hinduism, to gather, talk, make friends, and learn. We want this to be a safe space for those interested in living a Hindu life, regardless of their background, or their pre-existing level of knowledge. Likewise, we want this to be a place where Hindus can discuss, debate, and test their ideas with other Hindus.

**What We Are Not**   
A place for people to spread vulgarity or hate   
A place for non-Hindus to proselytize other religions   
A place for non-Hindus to demand justification for Hindu faith
