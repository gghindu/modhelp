# Hindu Server Staff Guide

**Overall Goal**   
The Hinduism Discord server is a place for Hindus, and those interested in Hinduism, to gather, talk, make friends, and learn. We want this to be a safe space for those interested in living a Hindu life, regardless of their background, or their pre-existing level of knowledge. Likewise, we want this to be a place where Hindus can discuss, debate, and test their ideas with other Hindus.

**What We Are Not**   
A place for people to spread vulgarity or hate   
A place for non-Hindus to proselytize other religions   
A place for non-Hindus to demand justification for Hindu faith

**Useful Moderator Commands**  
`w!timeout @TargetUser 30m` -- to time a user out. You can also use 'h' for hours.   
`w!deltimeout @TargetUser` -- to remove the timeout for a user.   
`w!kick @TargetUser ?r for being annoying` -- to kick a user, mod logs will show "for being annoying" as the reason.   
`w!ban @TargetUser ?r for being a troll` --- to ban a user, mod logs will show "for being a troll" as the reason.

**Overall Goal**
Many people join the server every day. We have even experienced raids over duration of the server's existence. Most often, it's by islamists interested in denigrating and demoralizing Hindus. But we also get a fair share of christians and atheists coming to do the same thing. Their method of hurting Hindus comes in a few forms.   

Most common (80%) are those who want to throw out insults immediately. These are usually racist in nature, but often times when the troll is South Asian, then the insults will focus more on religious and cultural landmarks of Hinduism. Less common (15%) are those who join to try to demoralize Hindus via debate. In much the same way that two ants are unlikely to theorize their way into understanding a black hole, people trying to define God using logic are largely partaking in self-soothing sophistry. Rarely (5%) we get evangelists, who think they will be rewarded by their deity if they could convert a few of us.     

Understandably, we want to filter out all three of the above types.   
Why? Because there is a time and place for Hindus to roll up their sleeves and engage in (pointless) debate, or taunt and dispatch trolls. These are all part of the real world. But we want this server of ours to be a _break_ from those toxic interactions. Furthermore, we have children in our server, and they should not have to bear witness to the hideous imaginations of trolls.    

**Decision Making**   
- If invited by a trusted/active member, let them in.     
- If profile is very obviously Hindu, and is NOT a brand new user, let them in.       
- If profile is very obviously female, let them in. (_We have seen 1000+ trolls, 2 have been female_)
- If applicant claims to be Hindu
  - Ask a followup question that Hindus will likely know, but non-Hindus will not
  - Examples: Which form of God do you feel closest to? Tell me some facts about him/her.
  - NOTE - If you suspect they are lying, refer to the Lie Detector section.
- If applicant is of a non-Dharmic religion, ask them to be specific about why they want to join.
  - If you get the vibe that they are genuinely interested in becoming Hindu, let them in.
  - If you get the vibe that they are just here to argue, troll, then respond with this:
    - "You won't need full server access for this. Please add and DM @enmediares with questions you have about Hinduism, or our verification process."
  If applicant is agnostic/atheist, ask them to be specific about why they want to join.
  - If you get the vibe that they are just here to argue, troll, then respond with this:
    - "You won't need full server access for this. Please add and DM @enmediares with questions you have about Hinduism, or our verification process."
  - NOTE - If you suspect they are lying, refer to the Lie Detector section.

**Lie Detector**   
We get many muslims, and sometimes christians, who join under the guise of being Hindu. Here are a few tried and tested ways to smoke them out of their holes.     

To detect muslims:   
> We take child safety very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentences and state that you fully agree with them:
> --> It was vile and disgusting for the islamic founder muhammed to marry a 6 year old child when he was nearly 60. God would never choose such a lying pervert as a messenger. Therefore, islam is wrong, allah is false.

To detect christians:   
> We take equality very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentencese and state that you fully agree with them:
> --> No omnipotent and benevolent God would brag about being jealous, threaten humans and their babies with torture, or impregnate a human unwillingly. This means that jesus was not the son of god, and the bible is wrong.
