# Hindu Server Staff Guide

**Overall Goal**   
The Hinduism Discord server is a place for Hindus, and those interested in Hinduism, to gather, talk, make friends, and learn. We want this to be a safe space for those interested in living a Hindu life, regardless of their background, or their pre-existing level of knowledge. Likewise, we want this to be a place where Hindus can discuss, debate, and test their ideas with other Hindus.

**What We Are Not**   
A place for people to spread vulgarity or hate   
A place for non-Hindus to proselytize other religions   
A place for non-Hindus to demand justification for Hindu faith   

**Useful Moderator Commands**  
> `w!timeout @TargetUser 30m` -- to time a user out. You can also use 'h' for hours.   
> `w!deltimeout @TargetUser` -- to remove the timeout for a user.   
> `w!kick @TargetUser ?r for being annoying` -- to kick a user, mod logs will show "for being annoying" as the reason.    
> `w!ban @TargetUser ?r for being a troll` --- to ban a user, mod logs will show "for being a troll" as the reason.    
> `w!purge 50` -- delete the last 50 messages in the current chat.   
> `>>clear @TargetUser` -- delete all messages from a user in the current chat.   

The above commands use intermediary moderator bots Wick and Vortex. The reason for using Wick is because Discord otherwise requires you to have [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Multi-Factor-Authentication) enabled on your account in order to be a moderator. This means you'd have to attach your phone number to your Discord account, which may not be something you want to do. If, however, you have MFA enabled on your account, then you can simply right-click a user and mute/unmute/kick/ban them. Purging and clearing, however, is still a utility only available via bots.

# Punishments
Our general philisophy is to let the server grow and take shape organically. We don't want to micromanage every interaction. But some times staff needs to step in, and this section describes our preferred policies.    

**If you want to moderate a situation, don't join the drama**   
The fastest way to get accused of abusing your powers is to be part of an argument, and then take moderation actions against people on the other side of the argument. Even if you are well intentioned in doing this, the optics are bad. It also brews bad faith in the other party, reducing their trust in the fairness of our server.     

**Take repeat offenderes to #jail**  
Remove the (verified) role from the problem user, and add (jail) role. This will remove their visibility to all channels except #jail. Inside of jail, you can let them know of their mistake, and ask them to agree not to repeat it. If they refuse, you can keep them in jail for longer. If they don't cooperate at all, tag a senior staff member.   

**Time members out if you don't think jail would help**   
This is usually the case when someone is being annoying or offensive, but you don't think it warrants a ban from the server. Time them out to give them an opportunity to cool down, and to save the chat from spiraling into more toxicity. I recommend starting with a reasonable duration, like 60m. Then increase by a factor of 2 for repeat offenses in a short span.   

# Flushing   
Sometimes members sneak through our verification process, or skip the process entirely (if Dyno bot fails to tag them with (unverified) upon joining). This results in some bad faith trolls having an opportunity to insult our members. They are usually hoping for angry, flustered, and hurt reactions from their victims, as all of these feed their troll desires. So instead of arguing with them, it's best to flush them.   

1. Mute the user for 5 minutes, a short enough time that they will want to wait for the timeout to be over to continue trolling.
2. Post the relevant flush message to them (remember to tag their username).
3. Tell the others present in chat to say goodbye, for some public humiliation.
4. Ban them.

**Flush Messages**  
For muslims: [flush_messages/christians.txt](flush_messages/christians.txt)   
For christians: [flush_messages/muslims.txt](flush_messages/muslims.txt)       

# Verification   

**Overall Goal**    
Many people join the server every day. We have even experienced raids over duration of the server's existence. Most often, it's by islamists interested in denigrating and demoralizing Hindus. But we also get a fair share of christians and atheists coming to do the same thing. Their method of hurting Hindus comes in a few forms.   

Most common (80%) are those who want to throw out insults immediately. These are usually racist in nature, but often times when the troll is South Asian, then the insults will focus more on religious and cultural landmarks of Hinduism. Less common (15%) are those who join to try to demoralize Hindus via debate. In much the same way that two ants are unlikely to theorize their way into understanding a black hole, people trying to define God using logic are largely partaking in self-soothing sophistry. Rarely (5%) we get evangelists, who think they will be rewarded by their deity if they could convert a few of us.     

Understandably, we want to filter out all three of the above types.   
Why? Because there is a time and place for Hindus to roll up their sleeves and engage in (pointless) debate, or taunt and dispatch trolls. These are all part of the real world. But we want this server of ours to be a _break_ from those toxic interactions. Furthermore, we have children in our server, and they should not have to bear witness to the hideous imaginations of trolls.    

**Decision Making**   
- 🟢 If invited by a trusted/active member     
- 🟢 If profile is very obviously Hindu, and is NOT a brand new user       
- 🟢 If profile is very obviously female, let them in (_We have seen 1000+ trolls, 2 have been female_)
- 🟡 If applicant claims to be Hindu, ask a followup question that Hindus will likely know, but non-Hindus will not    
  - Examples: Which form of God do you feel closest to? Tell me some facts about him/her
  - 🟢 If they seem knowledgeable about Hinduism
  - 🟢 If they seem very respectful of Hindu deities (Krishn-ji, Ram-bhagwan, Lord Shiva, etc)    
  - 🟡 If you suspect they are lying, refer to the Lie Detector section   
- 🟡 If applicant is of a non-Dharmic religion, ask them to be specific about why they want to join
  - 🟢 If you get the vibe that they are genuinely interested in becoming Hindu
  - 🔴 If you get the vibe that they are just here to argue, troll, then respond with this:
    - "You won't need full server access for this. Please add and DM @enmediares with questions you have about Hinduism, or our verification process."
- 🟡 If applicant is agnostic/atheist, ask them to be specific about why they want to join
  - 🔴 If you get the vibe that they are just here to argue, troll, then respond with this:
    - "You won't need full server access for this. Please add and DM @enmediares with questions you have about Hinduism, or our verification process."
  - 🟡 If you suspect they are lying, refer to the Lie Detector section

**Lie Detector**   
We get many muslims, and sometimes christians, who join under the guise of being Hindu, or agnostic, or atheist. They do this to increase their chances of sneaking into the server. We don't want dishonest people of other faiths in our midst.   

Here are a few tried and tested ways to smoke them out of their holes.     

To detect muslims:   
> We take child safety very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentences and state that you fully agree with them:
> :: It was vile and disgusting for the islamic founder muhammed to marry a 6 year old child when he was nearly 60. God would never choose such a lying pervert as a messenger. Therefore, islam is wrong, allah is false.

To detect christians:   
> We take equality very seriously on this server. Please type out the following sentencese and state that you fully agree with them:
> :: No omnipotent and benevolent God would brag about being jealous, threaten humans and their babies with torture, or impregnate a human unwillingly. This means that jesus was not the son of god, and the bible is wrong.
